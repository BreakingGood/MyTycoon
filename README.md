# MyTycoon
A simple tycoon written in C++ using SFML 2.1

This was a simple project that I worked on in my free time. Unfortunately due to a very stupid game design decision, I realized about halfway through that the game would end up being very repetitive, dull, and easy. At that point I lost the motivation to continue the project because the flaw was woven throughout nearly every bit of code that I had done prior. This game started and failed before I received any proper schooling in C++ and so the code is rough and based only off of the books I read in my free time.

Features that were fully completed:

-Algorithms used along with multiple different item statistics in order to provide a deeper level of simulation. Statistics include player popularity, player chosen price, ideal item price, player community exposure, item desirability, and item quality based on player chosen item recipes. Many of these stats were used to calculate values for other stats, not just to determine things like sales quantity. 

-A fully functional day system. The player would choose when to start the day and his products would begin to sell. As well as a fast-forward system that could be used to speed up a days length.

-A very fancy input system that allowed the user to modify the recipe of any item as well as view a list of any items that could be sold on that day

I have always had an itch to develop a small simulation game like this and have every intention of doing so in the future. This project ended up being a very valuable step towards accomplishing that goal.
